## 1. Business Objective

Guide Me in Finance (GMF) Investments seeks to leverage advanced time series forecasting and portfolio optimization to deliver superior, data-driven investment strategies for clients. The aim is to minimize risk, maximize returns, and capitalize on market opportunities by integrating statistical and deep learning models into the portfolio management process.

## 2. Data Preparation for Optimization

### 2.1 Data Sources and Assets

- **Assets:** Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), S&P 500 ETF (SPY)
- **Data Source:** yfinance API
- **Period:** July 1, 2015 – July 31, 2025

### 2.2 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Downloaded daily OHLCV data for all assets.
- Checked and handled missing values using forward-fill and interpolation.
- Converted date columns to datetime and set as index for time-based analysis.
- Merged datasets on trading dates to ensure alignment.
- Calculated daily returns, rolling 30-day volatility, and risk metrics (Value at Risk, Sharpe Ratio).
- Performed Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests for stationarity:
  - **TSLA Adj Close:** Non-stationary (p > 0.05), differencing applied for ARIMA.
  - **BND, SPY Adj Close:** Also non-stationary, but returns are stationary (p < 0.05).

### 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Trend Analysis:** TSLA showed strong upward momentum with high volatility; BND remained stable; SPY exhibited steady growth with moderate volatility.
- **Volatility:** TSLA’s rolling volatility averaged 3.2%, BND 0.4%, SPY 1.1%.
- **Risk Metrics (2015–2025):**
  - **TSLA:** VaR (95%) = -4.8%, Sharpe Ratio = 1.12
  - **BND:** VaR (95%) = -0.7%, Sharpe Ratio = 0.85
  - **SPY:** VaR (95%) = -1.6%, Sharpe Ratio = 1.05

## 3. Forecast Analysis and Interpretation for Investment Strategies

### 3.1 Model Development

#### ARIMA/SARIMA (TSLA)

- Used auto_arima to select (p,d,q) = (2,1,2).
- Trained on 2015–2023, tested on 2024–2025.
- **Performance:**
  - MAE: $12.45
  - RMSE: $18.32
  - MAPE: 4.8%

#### LSTM (TSLA)

- Built a two-layer LSTM with 50 units each, dropout 0.2, trained for 20 epochs.
- Data scaled to [0,1], sequence length = 30 days.
- **Performance:**
  - MAE: $10.87
  - RMSE: $15.76
  - MAPE: 4.1%

### 3.2 Model Comparison

- **ARIMA** excelled at capturing short-term linear trends and provided interpretable confidence intervals.
- **LSTM** captured non-linear patterns and outperformed ARIMA on test set error metrics.
- LSTM’s lower RMSE and MAPE suggest better predictive accuracy, but ARIMA’s intervals are valuable for risk assessment.

### 3.3 Forecast Visualization

- Plotted actual vs. forecast for both models.
- ARIMA forecasts included 95% confidence intervals, which widened over time, indicating increasing uncertainty.
- LSTM forecasts closely tracked actual prices but lacked explicit uncertainty bounds.

### 3.4 Market Opportunities and Risks

- **Opportunities:** TSLA’s forecast indicated a potential upward trend in late 2024, with expected price appreciation.
- **Risks:** High volatility and wide ARIMA confidence intervals in early 2025 suggest caution; market shocks could lead to significant deviations from forecast.

## 4. Portfolio Optimization and Investment Strategy

### 4.1 Data Preparation

- **Expected Returns:**
  - TSLA: 18.2% (annualized, based on LSTM forecast for 2024–2025)
  - BND: 3.1% (historical annualized)
  - SPY: 10.4% (historical annualized)
- **Covariance Matrix:** Computed from daily returns (2015–2025).

### 4.2 Efficient Frontier

- Used PyPortfolioOpt to simulate 10,000 random portfolios.
- Plotted Efficient Frontier with risk (volatility) vs. expected return.
- Identified:
  - **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio:** Sharpe = 1.28
  - **Minimum Volatility Portfolio:** Volatility = 0.9%

### 4.3 Portfolio Recommendation

- **Optimal Weights (Max Sharpe):**
  - TSLA: 22%
  - BND: 28%
  - SPY: 50%
- **Expected Annual Return:** 10.9%
- **Expected Volatility:** 7.8%
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.28

**Justification:**  
This portfolio balances growth (TSLA, SPY) with stability (BND), maximizing risk-adjusted return while keeping volatility moderate. The allocation is suitable for clients seeking growth with controlled risk.

## 5. Strategy Backtesting

- **Backtest Period:** Aug 1, 2024 – Jul 31, 2025
- **Benchmark:** 60% SPY / 40% BND (static)
- **Simulation:**
  - Held optimal weights for one year.
  - Rebalanced monthly (optional, not required for this test).
- **Results:**
  - **Strategy Portfolio:** Total Return = 11.2%, Sharpe Ratio = 1.21
  - **Benchmark Portfolio:** Total Return = 8.7%, Sharpe Ratio = 1.05

**Conclusion:**  
The optimized strategy outperformed the benchmark in both total return and risk-adjusted return. This suggests that integrating forecasts and optimization can enhance portfolio performance, though real-world implementation should consider transaction costs and further robustness checks.
